In order to generate ApiDefinitions.cs and StructsAndEnums.cs via Objective Sharpie one must run the following command:

sharpie bind --output=<path_to_folder> --namespace=Flutter --sdk=iphoneos13.2 Flutter.framework/Headers/Flutter.h -scope Flutter.framework/Headers -c -xobjective-c F .

where 
- argument --sdk must match the SDK version bundled with the installed version of Xcode (i.e. iphoneos14.4 for Xcode 12.4)
- argument -xobjective-c must be provided AFTER argument -c
- the final dot is required

The command can be run after a Flutter module has been built for iOS integration.

For example, if we have a Flutter module located at <path_to_flutter_module>:
- navigate to   <path_to_flutter_module>
- run           flutter build ios-framework --no-profile --no-release
- navigate to   <path_to_flutter_module>/build/ios/framework/Debug/

If we're using Flutter 1.x, run the above Objective Sharpie command.
If we're using Flutter 2.x, navigate to Flutter.xcframework/ios-armv7_arm64/ and then run the Objective Sharpie command.

Objective Shapie will generate ApiDefinitions.cs and StructsAndEnums.cs at <path_to_folder> overwriting any existing file.

The generated files MUST always BE REVISED in order to:
- fix all the definitions decorated with Verify attribute (please see: https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/xamarin/cross-platform/macios/binding/objective-sharpie/platform/verify)
- fix all the definitions that generate errors when compiling the binding library
